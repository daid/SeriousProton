# ldump — serialization library for any lua type

`ldump` is a flexible serializer, able to serialize any data, starting with circular references, tables as keys, functions with upvalues, metatables and ending with coroutines, threads and userdata (by defining how they should be serialized). It outputs valid Lua code that recreates the original object, doing the deserialization through `load(data)()`. It aims for functionality and flexibility instead of speed and size, allowing full serialization of complex data, such as video game saves. The output is large, but can be drastically reduced with modern compression algorithms.

Inspired by [`Ser`](https://github.com/gvx/Ser). Supports Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and LuaJIT. Tested for edge cases, such as joined upvalues and _ENV redefinition. Fully annotated in compatibility with LuaLS.

> [!WARNING]
> `ldump`'s deserialization function is Lua's builtin `load`, which can load malicious code. Consider using JSON for untrusted data or use [safety measures](/docs/safety.md).

| Type                                      | Support      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| nil, boolean, number, string              | full         |
| function                                  | full         |
| userdata                                  | user-defined |
| thread                                    | user-defined |
| table                                     | full         |
| metatables[*](/docs/development.md#plans) | full         |


## TL;DR show me the code

```lua
local ldump = require("ldump")

local upvalue = 42
local world = {
  name = "New world",
  get_answer = function() return upvalue end,
}

local serialized_data = ldump(world)  -- serialize to a string
local loaded_world = load(serialized_data)()  -- deserialize the string

assert.are_equal(world.name, loaded_world.name)
assert.are_equal(world.get_answer(), loaded_world.get_answer())
```

## The full power of ldump

```lua
local ldump = require("ldump")

-- basic tables
local game_state = {
  player = {name = "Player"},
  boss = {name = "Boss"},
}

-- circular references & tables as keys
game_state.deleted_entities = {
  [game_state.boss] = true,
}

-- functions even with upvalues
local upvalue = 42
game_state.get_answer = function() return upvalue end

-- fundamentally non-serializable types if overridden
local create_coroutine = function()
  return coroutine.wrap(function()
    coroutine.yield(1337)
    coroutine.yield(420)
  end)
end

-- override serialization
game_state.coroutine = create_coroutine()
ldump.serializer.handlers[game_state.coroutine] = create_coroutine

local serialized_data = ldump(game_state)  -- serialize
local loaded_game_state = load(serialized_data)()  -- deserialize

-- assert
assert.are_equal(game_state.get_answer(), loaded_game_state.get_answer())
assert.are_equal(game_state.coroutine(), loaded_game_state.coroutine())
assert.are_equal(game_state.coroutine(), loaded_game_state.coroutine())

assert.are_same(game_state.player, loaded_game_state.player)
assert.are_same(game_state.boss, loaded_game_state.boss)
assert.are_same(
  game_state.deleted_entities[game_state.boss],
  loaded_game_state.deleted_entities[loaded_game_state.boss]
)
```

## Installation

- *Traditional way:* copy the [raw contents of init.lua from the latest release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/girvel/ldump/refs/tags/v1.4.0/init.lua) into your `<lib>/ldump.lua`
- *Recommended way:* `git clone -b v1.4.0 https://github.com/girvel/ldump` inside the `<lib>/` — you still would be able to do `require("ldump")`, and it would allow version management through git

## On module serialization

In most cases, if you want to serialize code and don't want all the used modules within to be recursively serialized -- you can turn on `ldump.preserve_modules`. As long as your code does `local module_name = require("module_name")`, not `local module_function = require("module_name").f` (meaning upvalues hold modules themselves, not their contents), all references to modules will be deserialized through require.

If you have a more complex case, where you need the references to the data inside the modules persisting between serialization, you can use branch `2.0-mark`. It provides `ldump.mark*` functions, that explain to `ldump.serializer` which part of the module is static and can be deserialized through require. It is a development branch, but thoroughly tested and actively used in my other project ([girvel/engine](https://github.com/girvel/engine)), so it's stable and ready to use.
